      <p>Before I dove into the tech world I worked a host of different jobs, primarily in customer service. I enjoyed
        solving problems for my customers but the same problems on repeat left me less engaged than I' d like. I had
        previous experience managing an eccomerce website and I thoroughly enjoyed implementing apps to make the site
        more engaging to our customers. I find customer feedback an excellent inspiration to create better experiences
        and I'd love to integrate that passion into my work as a developer.</p>
