## Overview

This is our code 301 Final Project while at Code Fellows. This is an app that helps you parse through the data received from an API call. Instead of trying to `console.log()` to parse through data in your own project, put the API link into our app to see the JSON object and get the relevant data (Remember, no API keys!). Our app will even give you the direct JavaScript that you need to access the data in your own project.
